# my-portfolio

This is online portfolio with three sections. The three sections are about, my works, and how to contact.
The projects section has placeholders for my future projects. This website changes colors when the screen size increases or decreases. 
When you click on the menu links it takes you directly to the section you selected. Plan on imrpoving it as my skills set expands.
