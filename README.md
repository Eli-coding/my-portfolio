# Portfolio

This is online portfolio with three sections. The three sections are about, my works, and how to contact.
The projects section contains 3 of my most recent projects. This website changes colors when the screen size increases or decreases. 
When you click on the menu links it takes you directly to the section you selected. Plan on improving it as my skills set expands.
